                        CRISPR has announced its new advancement: Gene Editing. This advancement allows doctors to edit the genes of our offspring, which can ameliorate deformities or halt the continuing chain of family-passed genetic issues such as diabetes. It has also grown in popularity to many families worldwide, who plan on paying a hefty price for gene edits of their future child in order for them to have an enjoyable life. While this is most definitely a groundbreaking invention that can save potential lives, it also comes with consequences such as an increase of “designer babies,” a possible worsening of the patient’s case, and a deepening of the wealth gap.

                        Gene editing allows families to request an editing of their child’s genes to make them just about anything. However, as more families become aware of and then consider using this technology, there will be an increase of “designer babies,” babies whose genes were edited in such a way as to make them physically attractive or intelligent. That will thus heighten the expectations of matching particular society-created standards. For example, a couple purchases the gene editing service and then requests their child’s genes to be edited in such a way as to remove the “ugliness” or “dumbness” parts of their DNA, thus making them likelier to have physical attractiveness and intelligence. Now, multiply this by the amount of other families doing the same thing to their child. When those children grow up as the physically attractive and intelligent person they were genetically edited to be, it becomes considered a new “normal,” meaning everybody must be physically attractive and intelligent according to their local societal standards. This could be a huge problem, especially for the non-privileged people who never had gene editing done to them. They will not get treated as nicely as their counterparts, thus also increasing discrimination, a massive societal issue that is supposed to not exist.

                        Even though gene editing is a powerful tool used to “cut off” faulty DNA, ridding the patient of a family-run problem such as diabetes or obesity can still cause problems in other areas. For instance, if a family requests for a removal of their child’s obesity gene, that removal can be the root cause of other rising problems due to shaken balance. A universal principle to put here is, “when there is positive, there is also negative.” The negative must balance with the positive. However, if we remove one negative in order to replace it with a positive, the negative-positive balance is broken. To restore it, there will come another issue in the DNA, which can possibly be worse than the initial obesity gene. It could be a deathly case of cancer, for example. It is crucial we don’t touch the genetic make-up of a being, since that can cause more problems to occur, problems that are possibly worse than the problem itself.

                        To get your child’s genetic information edited, you must pay a heavy price that goes up to the millions. Typically, most families do not have such money to comfortably afford this service. Only the wealthy can afford that luxury. This will definitely increase the wealth gap, since gene editing is yet another added benefit of being wealthy. There could be a poor family desperately in need of a gene editing service for their doomed child that cannot be afforded, while the wealthy get to spend their large sum on this same service in order to perfect their children. Wealthy families are also more likely to produce “designer babies” as well, while the babies coming from a lower income family have to struggle with their genetically given issues. There will then be an increase in discrimination between those who can and cannot afford a “perfection procedure,” which also widens the gap between the rich and the poor.

                        CRISPR has a long way to go with its advancedness. It may seem incredibly problem-solving on the surface, but does not benefit enough people. While this is a wonderful idea, it is unfortunately not a decent execution. People are bound to use a new invention for the wrong reasons as well, and this invention will not prevent that. Plus, it is more of a benefit for the wealthy, therefore not as problem-solving to the masses. Also, a key takeaway to know of is that whatever was destined to happen to somebody through their DNA must stay that way; attempting to change it may only worsen the situation.                     </p>
